If a graph use red bars to represent cold weather and blue bars for hot weather, it could lead to Stroop Effect "

  - question: 2
    answer: " Our attention is limited. Our brain can only process about 1% of the visual input data. In a visualization, information is competing for our attention. So if legends are used in the graph, it could take the user's attention away from important information, Meanwhile, our working memory is also limited, so it happens that the user can not remember legends and the graph at the same time. "

Weather forecast mapï¼Œwe use a circle to represent the sun, a drop shape to represent rain, and a swirl to represent a typhoon. "

  - question: 4
    answer: " When we get a Visualization designing task at first, our understanding of it is actually in the first stage of Proceduralization. We need to study the context and get to the second and third stage, which makes our performance becomes faster and less prone to error "

  - question: 5
    answer: " knowledge-driven cognitive tasks is Macro-cognition. It is actually the initial stage of Proceduralization. It requires high-loads of working memory and uses more time than automatic productions. Meanwhile, it also causes more errors "

  - question: 6
